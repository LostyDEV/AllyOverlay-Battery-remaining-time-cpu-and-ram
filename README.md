I've corrected and polished your text, adding better formatting and a clearer structure for a professional-looking README.md file. I've also integrated the new point about the Armoury Crate shortcut.

OverlayApp
A lightweight, minimal overlay for Windows to display system information such as CPU usage, available RAM, and battery life. This app is designed to be self-contained and easy to use on devices like the ASUS ROG Ally.

Features
Real-Time Metrics: Displays live CPU, RAM, and battery life information.

Minimalist Design: A transparent, always-on-top overlay that won't clutter your screen.

Customizable Position: Drag the overlay to your preferred location on the screen.

Hotkey Support: Press Shift + L to toggle the overlay's visibility. This hotkey can also be added as a shortcut on ASUS Armoury Crate.

How to Use
The app requires the .NET SDK 8.0.413, which you can download from the official Microsoft website. Once the SDK is installed, this software is plug-and-play.

Compatibility
This app has been tested on the ASUS ROG Ally Z1 Extreme. It may work with other Windows handhelds, but this has not been officially tested.





I'm incredibly happy to help out the PC handheld gaming community. If my work has made a difference for you, a small gesture like buying me a coffee or a beer would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all for your support!
